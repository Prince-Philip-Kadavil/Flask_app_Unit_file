# Flask_app_Unit_file

The Ansible project is a simple Flask application that is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance. The project uses the following Ansible tasks:

Install the required packages, including Git, Python 3, and Pip.
Install Flask.
Clone or update the Flask app and unit file from the GitHub repository.
Copy the unit file to the /etc/systemd/system directory.
Replace the user and group in the unit file with the current user and group.
Reload systemd.
Ensure that the service is enabled and running.
The Flask app is a simple hello world application that returns the message "Hello, World!" when you visit the root URL. The unit file is a systemd unit file that ensures that the Flask app is started when the EC2 instance boots up.

To deploy the project, you would first need to create an Amazon EC2 instance and install Ansible on the instance. You would then need to clone the GitHub repository and run the Ansible playbook. Once the playbook has been run, the Flask app will be deployed and running on the EC2 instance.

Here are some of the benefits of using this project:

It is a simple and easy-to-understand project that demonstrates how to deploy a Flask application on an Amazon EC2 instance using Ansible.
It uses a well-known and widely-used technology stack, including Flask, Ansible, and systemd.
It is a portable project that can be easily deployed on any Amazon EC2 instance.
